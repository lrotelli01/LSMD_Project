\chapter{Introduction}
\textbf{LargeB\&B} is a web application that acts as an intermediary platform for booking accommodations. It enables travelers to search, compare, and book hotels, bed \& breakfasts, vacation rentals, apartments, and other types of lodging.

At the same time, the platform provides property owners and managers with the opportunity to promote their accommodations to a global audience, monitor bookings, and access detailed analytics on the performance of their properties.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Advanced search and filtering of available rooms based on location and review ratings.
    \item The ability for users to write and read reviews to help other travelers make informed decisions.
    \item Real-time chat communication between customers and property managers, both before and after booking.
    \item Access to analytics and performance insights for property owners regarding the accommodations they have published.
\end{itemize}
