This project presents \textbf{LargeBeB}, a web-based platform designed to modernize the management and booking process for Bed \& Breakfast (B\&B) accommodations. 

The system addresses the needs of two distinct user groups: travelers and property owners. For travelers, the platform offers an intuitive search engine that allows users to filter accommodations based on location, price range, and specific amenities, supported by a transparent review system. For property owners, the application provides a centralized dashboard to manage property listings, update room availability in real-time, and handle reservation requests efficiently.

Core functionalities include a secure booking workflow, dynamic pricing management, and a user-friendly interface designed to enhance the customer experience. The project aims to deliver a scalable and reliable solution that simplifies the operational complexity of the hospitality sector while ensuring high responsiveness and data consistency.
